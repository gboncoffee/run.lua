# run.lua

Simple compiling and testing automation for Neovim. Basically a rewrite of
[run.vim](https://github.com/gboncoffee/run.vim) but in Lua. Currently doesn't
support everything that's on the VimScript version.

# Usage

Implements the same command API that
[run.vim](https://github.com/gboncoffee/run.vim) implements, but currently
doesn't support everything. As I manage to get everything working I'll be adding
the proper documentation and other stuff. Keep tuned ;)
